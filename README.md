# Learn Python by Solving 25 Problems 



## Project Details 

This course is mainly for those who are just learning Python programming i.e. know about the basic syntax and structure of Python. In this course I mainly show beginner friendly solutions to 25 problems. In this case I followed the book "Python Crash Course".

The purpose of developing this course is only to share what I am learning with others. I hope this attempt of mine will be useful in your learning of programming. Good luck to you.
